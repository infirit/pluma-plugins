TextWrap-HOWTO

this document is about how i did this plugin. it might be
helpful finding your way to do similar, when you'll going
to do it like me for the first time. i.e. starting from
scratch and having no clue how to do that thing.

about installing this plugin or how to help see the README file.

it started with two sources of knowledge:

   * the PythonPluginHowTo.html
   * and the source code of SplitView2

so naming in my plugin is some kind of a mixture from both

if you are going to make errors like me in coding you will
likely want to debug your code by writing to stdout or seeing
the 'compiler' (python run time engine). to do so start gedit
calling gedit from the command line by it's command name gedit.

things i did different from the one or the other example:

internal functions (methods) starts with a underscore ('_')

i do not insert a menu, but a menu item, so the function is
called _remove_menu_item() instead of _remove_menu()

self._action_group is initialized in _insert_menu_item() so i deinitialized it in _remove_menu_item()
= moved self._action_group = None from deactivate() to _remove_menu_item()

there is no global manager reference, but a "local" inside the class: self._manager


GtkWrapMode gedit_prefs_manager_get_wrap_mode (void);
void        gedit_prefs_manager_set_wrap_mode (GtkWrapMode wp);
gboolean    gedit_prefs_manager_wrap_mode_can_set (void);


To get an idea of the XML structure of gedit menus see the
acommpanogion file TextWrap-merged-ui-xml
