add at least german translation to gedit-plugin file
shall it have a english (us english) entries then too?
include a setup dialog to setup (eg.
    use heuristic method to en- or disable text wrap for source code and non-source code files)
    use a persistent (ie. over restart) per file memory of textwrap setting by this plugin
    set the keyboard shortcut to whatever you like
        for the time we might have it inside a file beside the 'executable'?
shall have a better icon than gtk-stock-ok
shall have more translations than to german
    use ubuntu launchpad for that?
might have a status indicator in the status bar (if toolbar is disabled)
